# a framework to animate your P5 sketches 
This work comes from a realization made for a cyber Opera where graphics animations where needed.   
P5 allows many primitives to animate objects, but a framework appears as imperative to stay in schedule.  
This is a review of what was learned in this adventure. 

## chapter 1 : scenario 
A scenario is a way to schedule steps of animation in a practical way.   
Explanations and basic samples can be found in file **chap1-scenario.md**   
###  technical reading : Literals  
Documentation of the framework functions around standard literals objects.See file : **tech-Literals.md**
## chapter 2 : basic moveable elements 
A series of class, based on a common ancester, allows to display and move graphicals elements in 3D.   
To help the dev, sample is given to move the elements with keyboard keys and js console.   
Explanations and basic samples can be found at
 ***moveableObject.md***
